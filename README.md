## HTML Injection
[Repository Link](https://github.com/reyincyber/Hacktify-CS/tree/main/HTML%20Injection) | [Writeup](https://cyberrey.medium.com/html-injection-labs-walkthrough-hacktify-internship-8406228e9fd2)

HTML Injection occurs when user input is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious HTML into web pages. This can lead to unauthorized modifications of page content, phishing attacks, and user impersonation.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
[Repository Link](https://github.com/reyincyber/Hacktify-CS/tree/main/Cross-Site%20Scripting%20(XSS)) | [Writeup](https://cyberrey.medium.com/cross-site-scripting-xss-hands-on-lab-9f07bb8c8de2)

XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web applications, which can execute in a victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and website defacement.

## Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
[Repository Link](https://github.com/reyincyber/Hacktify-CS/tree/main/Insecure%20Direct%20Object%20References%20(IDOR)) | [Writeup](https://cyberrey.medium.com/insecure-direct-object-references-idor-hands-on-lab-93adbdd99602)

IDOR occurs when an application exposes internal objects (such as database records) without proper access control. Attackers can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## SQL Injection (SQLi)
[Repository Link](https://github.com/reyincyber/Hacktify-CS/tree/main/SQL%20Injection%20(SQLi)) | [Writeup](https://cyberrey.medium.com/sql-injection-sqli-hands-on-lab-d049af02b623)

SQL Injection is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code. This can lead to data leaks, unauthorized access, and database corruption.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
[Repository Link](https://github.com/reyincyber/Hacktify-CS/tree/main/Cross-Site%20Request%20Forgery%20(CSRF)) | [Writeup](https://cyberrey.medium.com/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-hands-on-lab-34346497f6bf)

CSRF attacks trick authenticated users into executing unwanted actions on a web application, often leading to account takeover, unauthorized transactions, or configuration changes.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
[Repository Link](https://github.com/reyincyber/Hacktify-CS/tree/main/Cross-Origin%20Resource%20Sharing%20(CORS)) | [Writeup](https://medium.com/@cyberrey/cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors-hands-on-lab-6a1d0b1b4d64)

CORS misconfigurations can allow unauthorized cross-origin requests, leading to data exposure and security risks for web applications that fail to enforce strict access control policies.

## Hacktify WK4 CTF
[Repository Link](https://github.com/reyincyber/Hacktify-CS/tree/8008ec0d8b2af76a3713b1448ccea066a1ec8894/Hacktify%20WK4%20CTF) | [Writeup](https://medium.com/@cyberrey/hacktify-ctf-2025-week-4-eed64269651d)

This section contains the Hacktify Week 4 Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and solutions, helping participants develop cybersecurity skills through practical problem-solving.

## HCPT Reports
[Repository Link](https://github.com/reyincyber/Hacktify-CS/blob/main/Hacktify%20HCPT%20Reports%20RU%20(1).pdf)

This report provides an in-depth analysis of various cybersecurity assessments conducted as part of the Hacktify HCPT program.
